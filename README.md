## Hardest Sections & Lessons Learnt

The navbar was particularly difficult because i had not learnt MaterialUI yet therefore i relied on floats to move my navigation content. This seemed like a good resolution until the navigation links started getting kicked out of the header section. A fix to this was to make sure the nav links were structured before the logo in html.

### Working Solution

The above solution was permanently and it make works as well as i wanted it to so i went on to learn MaterialUI Grid so i can find a fix for it.
